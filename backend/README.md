# Backend Web Application

This is the backend component of the web application project. It is built using Python and serves as the server-side logic for the application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web-app-project/backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the backend server, execute the following command:
```
python app.py
```

The server will start and listen for requests. You can access the API at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your app).
