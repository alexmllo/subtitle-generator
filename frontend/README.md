# Frontend Web Application

This directory contains the frontend part of the web application project.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
- `styles/style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and visual appearance of the web pages.
- `scripts/app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions and communicates with the backend server.

## Setup Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.
2. Ensure that the backend server is running to handle API requests.

## Usage

- Modify `styles/style.css` to change the appearance of the application.
- Update `scripts/app.js` to add or modify functionality in the frontend.
- Use the browser's developer tools to debug and test the frontend code.
